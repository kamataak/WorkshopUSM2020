## 1. Introduction
### Data
This example is example 2.25 in Muthen, Muthen, & Asparouhov (p.108, 2016), which was originally from data from an automobile parts work team study by Kellam et al. (2008).  

There are four variables ($n$ = 60):  
  - Dysfunctional behavior of team members (dysfunc: $x_i$)  
  - Team performance (performance: $y_i$)  
  - Negative affective tone (negtone: $m_i$)  
  - Negative expressibility (remove: $z_i$)  

The model to be analyzed is as follows:

### Moderated Mediation
For this model, the mediation effect of $x_i$ on $y_i$ through the mediator $m_i$ depends on the value of the covariate $z_i$ as $(\beta_1\gamma_1 + \beta_4\gamma_1z_i)(x_1-x_0)$. Here, $x_1-x_0$ can be the standard deviation of variable $x$. This way, the mediation effect is scaled *per* standard deviation. Note that the formula for the moderated mediation depends on the type of the model. This particular example is characterized as Model 14 in Hays (2018). 

### Read Data
Read and prepare data. Also, run descriptive statistics.
```{r}
teams <- read.table("Data/teams.txt")
colnames(teams) <- c("dysfunc","negtone","negexp","perform")
teams$mz <- teams$negtone * teams$negexp
teams %>% describe(fast=T)
```

### Specifications for lavaan
Assume we would like to set up evaluation points of moderated mediation to be -0.4 to 0.6 with an increment of 0.1 on the value of `negtone`. Also, set $x_0=.035$ as the mean of `dysfunc`, and $x_1=.4038$ as $\bar{x}+1SD$, such that $x_1-x_0 = .4038-.035 = .3688$ indicates $1SD$ and the mediation effect is scaled *per* 1SD change of $x_i$. If a model would be written manually for `lavaan`, it will look like this:
```{}
ex2.25.inp <- '
perform ~ b1*negtone + dysfunc + negexp + b4*mz
negtone ~ g1*dysfunc
med1 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(-.4))*.3688
med2 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(-.3))*.3688
med3 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(-.2))*.3688
med4 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(-.1))*.3688
med5 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(0))*.3688
med6 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(.1))*.3688
med7 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(.2))*.3688
med8 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(.3))*.3688
med9 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(.4))*.3688
med10 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(.5))*.3688
med11 := (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(.6))*.3688
'
```

However, this will become quite labor intensive, as we wish to increase the number of evaluation points. To overcome this, we can code in R to generate above model specifications. This way, we can easily specify many evaluation points with minimal effort. Note that we specify the lowest value (`from` = ), highest value (`to` = ) and increment (`by` = ) in the `seq` function below.
```{r}
eval.pts <- seq(from = -.4, to = .6, by = .1)

main.part <- c(
'perform ~ b1*negtone + dysfunc + negexp + b4*mz',
'negtone ~ g1*dysfunc')
med.part <- 
  capture.output(
    for (i in 1:length(eval.pts)){
      cat('med', i, ':= (b1*g1 + b4*g1*(', eval.pts[i], '))*.3688', 
          sep='', fill=T)
      })
ex2.25.inp <- c(main.part, med.part) %>% paste0(collapse = ' \n ')
```

Run the model with 1,000 bootstrap iterations.
```{r}
ex2.25.out <- sem(ex2.25.inp, data=teams, se="boot", bootstrap=1000)
```

### View a summary output
As you can see, there are multiple "defined parameters", which are mediation effects at different evaluation points.
```{r}
summary(ex2.25.out)
```

### Extract parameter estimates
The table including lower and upper bounds of Bootstrap confidence intervals.
```{r}
parameterEstimates(ex2.25.out)
```

Now, extract only the point estimates and lower & upper bounds of CI for mediation effects. Since mediation effects have lavaan operator `:=`, we will first filter the above parameter estimate data table by `filter(op == ":=")`. Then, select only `est` (point estimates of mediation effects), `ci.lower` (lower bound of 95% CI) and `ci.upper` (upper bound of 95% CI). Store the extracted moderated mediation results as `modmed.out`. 
```{r}
modmed.out <- 
  parameterEstimates(ex2.25.out) %>% 
  filter(op == ":=") %>% 
  select(est, ci.lower, ci.upper) %>% 
  cbind(eval.pts, .)
modmed.out
```

Inspection of the above table indicates that the 95% CI did not captures 0, when the evaluation point was -0.1 or higher. In other words, the mediation effect was statistically significant at $\alpha=.05$ level, when the value of the covariate `negexp` was -0.1 or larger.

### Plotting Moderated Mediation
We can plot the results. This requires to reshape the result data before using `ggplot`.
```{r}
modmed.out %>% 
  gather("estimates","values", 2:4) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=eval.pts, y=values, colour=estimates)) + 
    geom_line() + ylab("Mediation Effect") + xlab("Value of Covariate")
```

As we can see, the upper bound of the 95% CI intersects with 0, somewhere between -0.2 and -0.1, which means that the region of statistical significance is when the value of covariate was about -0.15 or larger. If we need to derive a more accurate threshold of statistical significance, we need to run the analysis with evaluation points with smaller increment, such as 0.01.
